# Description of Trie
Trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. Keys tend to be associated with leaves, though some inner nodes may correspond to keys of interest. Hence, keys are not necessarily associated with every node.

# Example of trie structure

In the above example inserted keys are: "A", "to", "tea", "ted", "ten", "i", "in", and "inn" (the children are alphabetically sorted from left to right which is not shown in the figure).

# To run the code
Simply compile all the .java files and run the Main file
